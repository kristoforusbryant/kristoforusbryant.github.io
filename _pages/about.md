### career
As a Software Engineer in the Data Science and Machine Learning team, I work on the company’s machine learning initiatives such as Sales Forecasting, Personalised Offer Assignment, and LLM use-cases.
The scope of my work spans the end-to-end machine learning pipeline from defining the use case, training and evaluating the model, implementing MLOps, and building Data Apps for our stakeholders.

Previously, in the same company, I was the Lead Software Engineer responsible for the international deployment of our mobile and web applications where I led a team of 4 software engineers in deploying our [customer](https://www.burgerking.co.nz/) [facing](http://popeyes.es/) [apps](https://www.firehousesubs.ch/) in 20+ markets globally.

These days, I program mostly in Python and JavaScript and most of my code are deployed to AWS and Snowflake. I am a [AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Professional](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-professional/).

### education
In 2021, I graduated *cum laude* from [Yale-NUS College](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/about-yale-nus/) with an undergraduate degree in [Mathematical, Computational and Statistical Sciences (MCS)](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/mcs).

My undergraduate thesis was titled “Bayesian Inference of Gaussian Graphical Models using Cycle Basis Priors” which proposes a novel state space prior for Bayesian inference of Gaussian Graphical Models, along with an MCMC algorithm to sample from the posterior. 
This work was completed under the guidance of [Prof Maria de Iorio](https://medicine.nus.edu.sg/sites/bids/people.html). 
After my graduation, the team refined and expanded on this work, which led to a [journal publication](https://doi.org/10.1017/jpr.2023.33) in 2023.

Further, I was also deeply involved in the Peer Tutoring program, where I tutored several topics in Mathematics and Statistics, such as: Probability, Statistical Inference, Linear Algebra, Real Analysis, Proof, and Modelling and Optimization. 

### miscellaneous
In my years working as a Software engineer, I retain my interest towards research, computational statistics, and mathematics. 
My latest interests includes keeping up with [Technical AI Safety](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tG9LGHLzQezH3pvMs/recommendations-for-technical-ai-safety-research-directions) discussions and attempting to formalize probability proofs in [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/).
I drift in and out of these “projects”, but have always hoped that I will someday have time to dedicate more to these pursuits.

My legal name is Kristoforus Bryant Odang, which is also the name I have been using in my articles and publications. People call me Kris.
